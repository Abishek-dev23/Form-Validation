## About

FormValidation is a demonstration project to showcase how to validate user input in web forms. The validation is applied both on the client side (for quicker feedback to the user) and on the server side (for security and data integrity).  

It is useful as a learning resource or starting point for your own projects that require safe form submissions.

## Features

- Real-time client-side validation using JavaScript  
- Server-side validation using Node.js (e.g. checking again before accepting data)  
- Clean and responsive UI (HTML + CSS)  
- Modular code structure  
- Sample test insert script (for simulating or testing form submission)

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abishek-dev23/FormValidation.git
   cd FormValidation
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the server:

bash
Copy code
node server.js
Open the frontend form in your browser:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:3000
Try submitting the form with various valid/invalid inputs to see how validation works on both client and server sides.

Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Node.js with built-in HTTP server (or Express, if you integrate it)

Validation: Pure JavaScript for client-side logic; server-side checks in Node.js

Testing / Script: testInsert.js to simulate or test form insertion

Validation Rules
Some examples of validation rules implemented:

Required fields must not be empty

-> Email must follow a valid email format

-> Passwords must meet minimum length / complexity

-> Confirm password must match password

-> Additional rules as per your project needs

(You can expand this section to list all the validation rules you support.)

Testing
-> Use testInsert.js to simulate form submissions programmatically.
-> Manually test the UI by submitting the form with invalid inputs and verifying the feedback and error messages.
